# First Responder Emergency Guide

## Basic First Aid

### CPR Protocol
1. Check the scene for safety.
2. Check the person for responsiveness by tapping their shoulder and shouting "Are you OK?"
3. If the person is unresponsive, call 911 or ask someone else to do so.
4. Check for breathing. If they are not breathing or only gasping, begin CPR.
5. Place your hands on the center of the chest and perform 30 compressions.
6. Open the airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift method.
7. Give 2 rescue breaths, ensuring the chest rises.
8. Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency services arrive.

### Bleeding Control
1. Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage.
2. If blood soaks through, add additional cloth without removing the original.
3. If possible, elevate the wounded area above the heart.
4. For severe bleeding, apply a tourniquet if available.
5. Mark the time when the tourniquet was applied.

## Fire Emergency Procedures

### Building Fire Response
1. Activate the nearest fire alarm.
2. Call 911 and report the fire.
3. If the fire is small and contained, use a fire extinguisher (PASS method: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep).
4. If the fire is large or spreading, evacuate immediately.
5. Feel doors before opening. If hot, find another exit route.
6. Stay low to avoid smoke inhalation.
7. Close doors behind you to contain the fire.
8. Proceed to the designated assembly area.

### Wildfire Response
1. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.
2. Choose an evacuation route away from the fire.
3. Take emergency supplies and important documents.
4. If trapped, stay in an area with minimal vegetation.
5. Create a defensible space around structures.
6. Wet down roofs and areas around buildings if possible.
7. Stay informed through emergency broadcasts.

## Natural Disaster Response

### Earthquake Protocol
1. Drop to the ground before the earthquake knocks you down.
2. Take cover under sturdy furniture or against an interior wall.
3. Hold on until the shaking stops.
4. If outdoors, move to an open area away from structures and utilities.
5. After shaking stops, check for injuries and damage.
6. Be prepared for aftershocks.

### Flood Response
1. Move to higher ground immediately.
2. Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters.
3. If trapped in a building, go to the highest level (not the attic).
4. If trapped in a vehicle in rising water, abandon the vehicle for higher ground.
5. Listen to emergency services for evacuation orders.

## Medical Emergencies

### Heart Attack Signs and Response

5. Do not touch or walk through spilled material.
6. Avoid inhalation of fumes, smoke, or vapors.
